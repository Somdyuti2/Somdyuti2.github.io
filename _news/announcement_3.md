I am looking to recruit a highly motivated Junior Research Fellow (JRF) to join my research group on an ANRF funded project that explores cutting-edge generative models for video compression. Due to the explosive growth of global video traffic over the internet, traditional compression techniques for video data face increasing challenges to meet performance and scalability demands. In this project, we aim to build a generative framework for video compression. By conditioning generative models on perceptual quality and motion information, we seek to compress and reconstruct video efficiently without compromising on visual fidelity.

##### **What You Will Work On**
* Designing and training latent diffusion models for compressing video frames

* Developing quality and motion-aware conditioning mechanisms for generative models based on diffusion and normalizing flows

* Building evaluation pipelines using perceptual quality metrics
