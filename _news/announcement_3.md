I am looking to recruit a highly motivated candidate to join my research group as a Junior Research Fellow (JRF), working on [ANRF](https://www.anrfonline.in/ANRF/HomePage)-funded project that explores cutting-edge generative models for video compression. Due to the explosive growth of global video traffic over the internet, traditional compression techniques for video data face increasing challenges to meet performance and scalability demands. In this project, we aim to build a generative framework for video compression. By conditioning generative models on perceptual quality and motion information, we seek to compress and reconstruct video efficiently without compromising on visual quality and fidelity.

This research role ideal for someone who is passionate about deep learning, generative models, and computer vision, and who wants to work at the intersection of AI, signal processing and vision science.

##### **What You Will Work On**
* Modeling quality of AI generated visual data
* Developing quality and motion-aware conditioning mechanisms for generative models based on diffusion and normalizing flows.
* Building image/video compression frameworks using conditional generative models. 
* Optimizing generative compression models for computational efficiency. 


##### **Essential Qualification**
B. Tech in ECE/EE/CS/AI (or related disciplines) with valid GATE/NET score in any one of these
disciplines with >= 75% / 8.0 CGPA throughout academic career (including X, XII and B. Tech)  

OR  

M. Tech in ECE/EE/CS/AI with >= 75% / 8.0 CGPA throughout academic career (including X, XII, B. Tech and M. Tech).

##### **Desired Experience**

1. Strong foundations in deep learning and generative AI, computer vision
and/or image/video processing. linear algebra, calculus, probability, statistics
and optimization
2. Proficiency in Python programming with hands-on experience in deep
learning frameworks (PyTorch preferred).
3. Hands-on experience in solving practical computer vision and/or
image/video processing problems with libraries such as OpenCV.
4. Familiarity with Linux based high performance computing systems.
5. Ability to conduct independent scientific exploration and proficiency in
academic writing

##### **Fellowship & Duration:**

**Duration:** 2 years (extendable based on performance and funding availability)

**Fellowship:** Up tp â‚¹37,000/month (depending on qualification and experience)

##### **To Apply**
Interested candidates can apply directly through IIT Kharagpur's online recruitment portal:
